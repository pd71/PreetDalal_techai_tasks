# Task 1: Wordle Clone

This project implements a Wordle game in Python. Users have 6 attempts to guess a five-letter word, with color-coded feedback indicating correctness:

Green → Correct letter in the correct position

Yellow → Correct letter in the wrong position

Gray → Letter not in the word

## Project Structure

   git clone https://github.com/pd71/PreetDalal_techai_tasks
   ```

2. No dependencies required to be installed.

## Usage

Note that this program will not function properly on Command Prompt and Windows Powershell due to lack of ANSI support.
